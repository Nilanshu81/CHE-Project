            <p>Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities, in such a manner that negatively affects its legitimate uses. Water pollution reduces the ability of the body of water to provide the ecosystem services that it would otherwise provide.</p>

                <h1>Sewage and wastewater</h1>
                <p>
                    Used water is wastewater. It comes from our sinks, showers, and toilets (think sewage) and from commercial, industrial, and agricultural activities (think metals, solvents, and toxic sludge). The term also includes stormwater runoff, which occurs when rainfall carries road salts, oil, grease, chemicals, and debris from impermeable surfaces into our waterwaysMore than 80 percent of the worlds wastewater flows back into the environment without being treated or reused, according to the United Nations; in some least-developed countries, the figure tops 95 percent. In the United States, wastewater treatment facilities process about 34 billion gallons of wastewater per day

				<a name = "water" class="water"><h1>Water Pollution</h1></a>
				<p class="descw">Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment.</p>
				<div class="totalwater">
					<div class="proswater">
						<h3>Causes</h3>
						<p>Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal solvent,” water is able to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on earth. Water pollution can usually be attributed to one of four sources: sewage, industry, agriculture, and urban runoff including stormwater. For example, releasing inadequately treated wastewater into natural waters can lead to degradation of these aquatic ecosystems. Water pollution can also lead to water-borne diseases for people using polluted water for drinking, bathing, washing or irrigation.</p>
					</div>
								
					<div class="proswater">
						<h3>Preventions</h3>
						<p>Reduce your plastic consumption and reuse or recycle plastic when you can.
							Properly dispose of chemical cleaners, oils, and nonbiodegradable items to keep them from going down the drain.
							Maintain your car so it does not leak oil, antifreeze, or coolant. Be mindful of anything you pour into storm sewers, since that waste often won’t be treated before being released into local waterways. If you notice a storm sewer blocked by litter, clean it up to keep that trash out of the water.
							Don't put fertilizer on the grass right before it rains. The chemicals will wash into storm drains and waterways.
						</p>
					</div>
								
					<div class="proswater">
						<h3>Facts</h3>
						<p>Approximately 785 million people in the world do not have access to clean drinking water because of pollution. Around 70% of the industrial waste is dumped into the water bodies where they pollute the usable water supply. Industry dumps an estimated 300-400 MT of polluted waste into water bodies every year. It includes millions of tonnes of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge and other wastes. Fourteen billion pounds of garbage, mostly plastic, is dumped into the ocean every year. 15 million children under the age of five die each year because of diseases caused by drinking water</p>
